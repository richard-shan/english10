# Greatest Hits

In my opinion, my greatest work of writing this year was my argumentative research essay on large language models. Because this assignment allowed me to choose my own topic, I was really self-driven to work on the essay. I had a lot of fun writing this, and I feel that the topics discussed in the essay are very relevant in today's climate. I also feel that this essay explores sufficient technical depth while also staying at a high enough level for a layman. Overall, I put a lot of time and effort into this essay and feel that it represents my interests and applications, both inside and outside of writing.
