# Writer's Toolbox

During my time as a writer this year, I've come up with a couple of key takeaways that fueled my growth. Each takeaway is given an short abbreviation that I am sure will be incredibly useful to any and all who visit this site.

### Make a Plan, and Stick To It (MAPSTICK)

At the beginning of every large assignment, your teacher will usually post some mini-deadlines or a progress map. I would recommend sticking to this as much as possible, as it means your last few days on the assignment give time to really polish it up and aggregate all your writing.

### Write About What You're Passionate About (WAWYPA)

Unlike writing a literary analysis on a book or poem that you were forced to read, free-topic papers really allow you to explore whatever you are interested in. I find that writing about something I am passionate about independently drives me to try my best on the paper and actually work ahead of schedule.

### Don't Suffocate Your Teacher in Big Vocab Words (DONUTBOMBARD)

As can be seen in my essays from the start of the year, sometimes I tend to overuse big words. Although my teacher seems to think that I've swapped some of them out in favor of keeping it simple, I think I just got better at integrating big words while keeping a smooth sentence flow. However, the lesson from this is that simple is sometimes (SOMETIMES) better. 

### If It Sounds Bad, It's Probably Because It's Bad (IFBADTHENBAD)

Much of my editing of my own essays simply comes from feeling that something doesn't sound right. For grammatical issues (even really minor ones), reading it over usually is enough to alert me that something is wrong. Re-reading paragraphs can also be great for clarity and sentence flow issues. A lot of my editing is messing around with synonyms and arranging clauses in different fashions to create a good sentence.

### Check the Course Log (CCLOG)

Especially when juggling the English course load with a bunch of other classes and intensive extracurriculars, I find its easy to lose track of English homework since it isn't posted on Classroom. The course log allows easy access to daily homework but also a general idea of how the unit is organized and will go.
