Hi, I'm Richard. I am a very avid writer, creating multiple documents and producing hundreds of lines (of code) daily. In terms of literature, I don't really explore creative writing on my own time. However, I do regularly utilize technical writing and academic writing across a small variety of topics.

## Work

This section exhibits the various essays and assignments that I have produced throughout the year. This section is organized in chronological order, with earliest writings at the start of this year at the top, and latest writings at the bottom.
