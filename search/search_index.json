In terms of writing, I am great at writing code, creating multiple documents and producing hundreds of lines daily. I don't really explore creative writing on my own time. However, I do regularly utilize technical writing and academic writing across a small variety of topics. I especially enjoy the formal tone of technical/academic writing, even when the norms are unnecessarily pompous.</p>"},{"location":"#work","title":"Work","text":"<p>This section exhibits the various essays and assignments that I have produced throughout the year.

Although my teacher seems to think that I've swapped some of them out in favor of keeping it simple, I think I just got better at integrating big words while keeping a smooth sentence flow. However, the lesson from this is that simple is sometimes (SOMETIMES) better. </p>"},{"location":"toolbox/#if-it-sounds-bad-its-probably-because-its-bad-ifbadthenbad","title":"If It Sounds Bad, It's Probably Because It's Bad (IFBADTHENBAD)","text":"<p>Much of my editing of my own essays simply comes from feeling that something doesn't sound right. For grammatical issues (even really minor ones), reading it over usually is enough to alert me that something is wrong. Re-reading paragraphs can also be great for clarity and sentence flow issues. A lot of my editing is messing around with synonyms and arranging clauses in different fashions to create a good sentence.</p>"},{"location":"toolbox/#check-the-course-log-cclog","title":"Check the Course Log (CCLOG)","text":"<p>Especially when juggling the English course load with a bunch of other classes and intensive extracurriculars, I find its easy to lose track of English homework since it isn't posted on Classroom.
